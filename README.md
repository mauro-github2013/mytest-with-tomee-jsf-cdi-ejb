mytest-with-tomee-jsf-cdi-ejb
=============================

this is a personal test for development web application for tomee . i would change jsf from myfaces at primefaces.
but how i have to make it?
i have to add the jars of primefaces on web-inf/lib of my personal application or i have to delete from tomee/lib the jars of myfaces and put the jars of primefaces at the same position?
